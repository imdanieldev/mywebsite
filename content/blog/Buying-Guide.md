## Introduction

Over the past couple of years, I’ve repeated one message: **don’t judge technology products only by their price or by the number in their name.**  
Many buyers fall into the trap of thinking “higher price means better” or “bigger number means stronger.” In reality, the story is far more complex.

## Example 1: Earbuds and Market Hype

Take the popular **QCY T13X earbuds** in Iran.  
- When I bought them, they cost around **800,000 Toman**.  
- Today, they’re priced at **1,800,000 Toman**.  

At the same time, the **QCY T13 ANC** model was about **1,200,000 Toman**, but now it also sits at **1,800,000 Toman**. Why? Simply because demand for the T13X skyrocketed, pushing its price up. At that price range, there are **better alternatives**, but hype and sales volume distorted the market.

## Example 2: iPhone Pricing

Another case is the iPhone. At one point, the **iPhone 14** was actually cheaper than the **iPhone 13**, despite being newer. Why? Because the 13 had higher demand, and demand often drives price more than technical merit.

## Example 3: CPUs and Misleading Numbers

Many buyers assume that an **Intel i7** must be better than an **i3** because the number is higher.  
But the truth is: **the generation and architecture matter more than the label.**  
- A newer i3 can outperform an older i7.  
- The suffix numbers (e.g., 12700 vs 7700) reveal the generation and actual performance.  

Similarly, in mobile CPUs, you can’t just look at “Snapdragon 5xx vs 3xx.” You need to check the **cores (Cortex types)** and **nanometer lithography**. A chip labeled “5” might have weaker cores than one labeled “3.”

## Example 4: RAM Confusion

Another mistake: choosing **12 GB DDR3** over **8 GB DDR5**.  
The raw number looks bigger, but DDR5 is newer, faster, and more efficient. Performance depends on **generation and speed**, not just capacity.

---

## Example 5: Software Experience

Software matters as much as hardware.  
- **Nothing OS** looks simple, almost barebones. But it’s essentially **stock Android**, which means it runs smoothly and avoids bloat.  
- **Xiaomi’s HyperOS** looks flashy, full of effects and features. But after six months, it often slows down and becomes heavy.  

The lesson: **simplicity and stability often outperform flashy features in the long run.**

## Conclusion

When buying tech, don’t be fooled by:  
- **Price tags** inflated by hype and demand  
- **Model numbers** that hide generational differences  
- **Bigger specs** that ignore efficiency and architecture  

Instead, focus on:  
- The **generation** and **architecture** of CPUs and RAM  
- The **real-world performance** of devices, not just marketing numbers  
- The **software experience**, which can make or break a product over time  

Smart buying requires **strategy, research, and critical thinking** — not just chasing numbers or hype.  
That’s the message I’ve been repeating for years, and it’s more relevant today than ever.
