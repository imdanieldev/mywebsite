## Introduction

Many people claim that **iOS is more secure than Android**.  
The reasoning usually goes: *iOS doesn’t share data with third parties and gives apps fewer permissions.*  
But this argument is oversimplified. Let’s break it down.

## 1. Custom Android vs Stock Android

When you buy an Android phone from **Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, or others**, the operating system is **customized** by the manufacturer.  
- These versions often add features, skins, and sometimes extra services.  
- Security and privacy can vary depending on the company’s implementation.  

The only phones that run **Google’s own Android version** are **Pixel devices**. So judging “Android” based on heavily customized versions is misleading.

## 2. Android 15 and App Permissions

Starting with **Android 15**, Google has significantly restricted app permissions.  
- Apps now have **less access to sensitive data**.  
- Background permissions are more tightly controlled.  
This means modern Android is far closer to iOS in terms of limiting what apps can do.

## 3. The Reality of Security Concerns

Let’s be honest:  
- Unless you’re a **president or a high-profile target**, extreme paranoia about phone security is unnecessary.  
- For everyday users, both iOS and modern Android provide strong protections.

## 4. The AOSP Difference

Here’s the key point most people miss: **Android itself is not Google.**  
- The foundation of Android is **AOSP (Android Open Source Project)**.  
- AOSP is open-source, meaning anyone can read the code and verify whether it sends data or not.  
- AOSP by itself does **not include Google services**.  

When manufacturers add Google Play Services, that’s when data collection concerns arise. But pure AOSP is **clean, transparent, and secure**.

## 5. Performance and Stability

Running **AOSP without Google services or heavy manufacturer skins** has another benefit:  
- The phone stays **fast and stable**.  
- No unnecessary background processes slow it down.  
- Security is easier to audit because the code is open.

## Conclusion

The claim that “iOS is more secure than Android” is only partially true.  
- iOS does restrict app permissions, but modern Android (especially Android 15+) does the same.  
- The real Android — **AOSP** — is open-source, transparent, and not tied to Google’s data collection.  
- Security depends on **implementation and usage**, not just the brand name.  

So before repeating old myths, remember: **Android is not just Samsung or Xiaomi’s skin. It’s an open-source project that anyone can verify.**
